# Java-Programs
These are programming labs that were assigned in the Java 
Programming Course. This collection of programs is ongoing
as the course progresses. I will push code as and when the 
assignments are completed.

## Instruction for Use
You can clone the repo to your editor which you would use
for java programs and run the code in that environment.
